# Pro Tips

This is the source code for the Dynamic Web Applications course project.

The application is a tips forum, called `Pro Tips`, that allows developers to register and share short bits of advice with each other, and then comment on the tips others have created.  The application basics have been completed, such as the core routes, views, controller actions and models.  The application has been styled using [the Bootstrap CSS library](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/), and the files for this library have been included as `.scss` and `.js` files in the appropriate places within the `app/assets/` folder.
