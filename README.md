# Pro Tips

This is the _*Dynamic web applications*_ project course. Third course project of the _EPFL Extension School_ **Web Application Development Program**

This project was developed by [_Laura Elena GÃ³mez_](https://elenagoto.ch/), and was sumbmitted and approved in May 2020.

## Project Goals

The application is a tips forum, called `Pro Tips`, that allows developers to register and share short bits of advice with each other, and then comment on the tips others have created. The application basics have been completed, such as the core routes, views, controller actions and models. The application has been styled using [the Bootstrap CSS library](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/), and the files for this library have been included as `.scss` and `.js` files in the appropriate places within the `app/assets/` folder.

### Project tasks

- Ruby and refactoring (refactor existing code and add funcionalities using Ruby code).
- Ruby on Rails (use of scopes and locales).
- Authentication and authorization (implement authentication with secure password and implement autorization rules depending on the type of user - anonymous, registered and admin).
- Fine tuning, images, and AJAX (allow users to upload avatars, and make use of asynchronous requests to display or remove content).
- Deployment (make use of the production environment, deploy the application to Heroku and configure AWS to handle uploads)
